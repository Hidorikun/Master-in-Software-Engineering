exam structure: 
A. For a given set of requirements you have to: 
	* Analyze them using two or three characteristics from course 1 
	* Rewrite some of them using the Gherkin language ( given, when, then )
	* Prioritize them using two given techniques
B. Explain in your own words a concept from RE

course 1: 

requirements characteristics: 
1 Feasable
	If it is phisically possible 
	If you can do it with your resources 

2 Correct/Valid
	If it is exactly what the customer wants. 
	A must have
	If the user wants something inappropriate, it is still considered a correct requirement, as he wanted it 

3 Unambiguous
	You cannot think of it in multiple ways

4 Verifiable
	Can be tested

5 Modifiable
	It follows a structure/template that you can easily edit
	Should not have redundant information / duplicate , and modifications should not need to cascade

6 Consistent
	You must not have requirements that contradict one another
	Or in combination, make the program unfeasable to build

7 Traceable
	As we do in Jazz

course 5: 
prioritization
importance / risk / cost

Analytical HIerarchy Process (AHP)
* Compare every requirement with every other requirement and see what is more important
* N x (N-1) / 2 comporisons

Comulative Voting, the 100 dollar test
* you have $100, and 20 tasks, give it out to what you like the most

Numerical Assignment ( Grouping ) 
* Group requirements into 2 or 3 groups ( crritical, standard, optional ) for example 
* can put limits on the max number of elements in each group 
* there is no unique priority for a reuquirement

Ranking 
* you assign numbers from 1 to N to each requirement, and sort after that

Top Ten Requirements 
You choose 10, they have the same importnace
